* For the SoP Support Service, the incident type can be set to 'aggravation'.  This is intended to cover injuries or diseases covered by Section 27(d) and 30 of MRCA: basically non-service conditions made worse by service [#f1]_.  If the incident type is 'aggravation', the user of the service needs to provide both an onset date (or range of dates) and an aggravation date (or range of dates).  The requirement for both dates is to help evaluate SoP factors where the time between initial onset and aggravation is important.
