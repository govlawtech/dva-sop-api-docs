MRCA and VEA Operations Data
############################

The API provides an up-to-date machine-readable feed of legally recognised military operations.  This data is important because it impacts veterans'
entitlements to treatment and rehabilitation, as well as the quantum of compensation.  The feed includes both warlike and non-warlike operations under
the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Act, as well as warlike, non-warlike, hazardous and peacekeeping activities under the Veterans'
Entitlements Act. It includes dates, locations, names and legal references to the primary sources. 

DVA uses this feed currently in two ways:

* The Decision Ready Processing rules described below rely on it to make accurate determinations.
* MyService uses it directly to help veterans fill in their service	history accurately in online forms.
