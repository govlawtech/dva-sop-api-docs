Statements of Principles
########################

The API provides up-to-date machine-readable feed of data from all in-force Statements of Principle -- legislative instruments currently critical to DVA's administration of Compensation and Support -- Outcome 1 in the Portfolio Budget
Statements, comprising around \$6 billion dollars of expenditure.   There are 700 instruments, covering over 350 medical conditions and over 8500 *SoP Factors* (circumstances linking a medical condition to a veteran's
service).

The feed is derived automatically from the Federal Register of Legislative Instruments -- the authoritative source of law maintained by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel.

Currently, MyService uses this feed to: 

* Enable veterans to select SoP factors directly, shortcutting time-consuming correspondence and shortening claim processing time.  Typically MyService calls this function several hundred times each week.
* Obtain an accurate and up-to-date list of medical conditions for which DVA provides treatment and compensation.
