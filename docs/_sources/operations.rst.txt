 * Operation names are expected to be exactly as they appear in the relevant Service Determinations. 
 * Note the 'end of guarded area' character (U+0097) in the name 'Enduring Freedom |ga| Afghanistan'
 * The Operation Name for operation with description 'ADF contribution to the NATO no-fly-zone and maritime enforcement operation against Libya' is ``NNMEOAL``.  (The Service Determination omits a name, so we made one up to identify the operation.)
