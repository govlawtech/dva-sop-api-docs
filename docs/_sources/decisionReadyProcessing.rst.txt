Decision Ready Processing
##########################

The API applies *Decision Ready Processing* rules, including *Straight-Through*, *Streamlined* and *Computer Based* rules.  These are DVA's innovative policies designed to fast-track claims for certain conditions, based on the veteran's service history.   It applies the rules instantaneously to medical and service history data, and makes a recommendation, justified against current, authoritative primary legal sources. Ultimately, MyService may automatically approve a claim based on this recommendation, or forward it to a delegate with the recommendation attached. 

It has proven scalable and reliable: it has grown from initially three conditions to, at time of writing, these cover 40 conditions, accounting for approximately 77\% of initial liability claims.  MyService typically calls this service several dozen times each day.
